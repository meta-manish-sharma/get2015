				<p><b>History</b><br/>
					The first earth tracks were created by humans carrying goods and often followed game trails. Tracks would be naturally created at points of high traffic density.
					As animals were domesticated, horses, oxen and donkeys became an element in track-creation. With the growth of trade, tracks were often flattened or widened to
					accommodate animal traffic. Later, the travois, a frame used to drag loads, was developed. Animal-drawn wheeled vehicles were probably developed in the 
					Ancient Near East in the 4th or 5th millennium BC and spread to Europe and India in the 4th millennium BC and China in about 1200 BC. The Romans had a 
					significant need for good roads to extend and maintain their empire and developed Roman roads.
